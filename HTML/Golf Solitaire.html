                <h2>On the Subject of Golf Solitaire</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">A good sequel to Foxtrot Solitaire &mdash; I can&rsquo;t wait for Hotel Solitaire!</p>

                <p>A 7&times;5 formation of cards (the &ldquo;tableau&rdquo;) will be dealt when the module is initialised, and a card will be dealt to the discard pile (the &ldquo;foundation&rdquo;) above it. To solve the module, play all thirty-five cards in the tableau onto the foundation.</p>
                <p>A card can be played if both of the following conditions apply:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>It is not underneath any other cards (i.e. it is the topmost card of its pile). Cards which violate this condition are greyed out, and cannot be selected.</li>
                <li>It is either one higher or one lower than the top card of the foundation. Jacks equal 11, Queens equal 12 and Kings equal 13. The module will let you select cards which violate this condition, but will not let you play them.
                <ul>
                <li>If Hard Mode is disabled, Aces can be played on Kings, and vice versa.</li>
                <li>If Hard Mode is enabled, no cards may be played on Kings, except Jokers.</li>
                </ul></li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>A round ends when you have successfully cleared the tableau, or have exhausted the stock pile and have no legal moves. In the latter case, the cards will be collected, shuffled, and dealt for another round. If the number of cards left in the tableau last round was&hellip;</p>
                <ul>
                <li>&hellip; exactly 1: 3 Jokers have been added to the deck.</li>
                <li>&hellip; 3 or less: 2 Jokers have been added to the deck.</li>
                <li>&hellip; 8 or less: 1 Joker has been added to the deck.</li>
                <li>&hellip; 9 or more: you will receive no bonuses.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Jokers are wild &mdash; they are valid on any card, and all cards are valid on them.</p>
                <p>In No Bonuses mode, you do not receive Jokers.</p>
                <p>Hard Mode and No Bonuses can be turned on and off in mod settings. Missions can specify if they are on or off too, and this overrides the mod settings.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>This is done in the mission&rsquo;s description, like <code>[Golf Solitaire] XXX</code>.</li>
                <li>Use <code>[Golf Solitaire] bonuses on/off</code> to enable / disable Joker bonuses. [Turning this off enables No Bonuses mode.]</li>
                <li>Use <code>[Golf Solitaire] hard on/off</code> to enable / disable Hard Mode.</li>
                </ul>
